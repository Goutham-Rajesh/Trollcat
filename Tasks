# Trollcat

## the_sus_agent
It was a .pcapng file. After i used to find packet from edit in the main menu and searched trollcat but couldn't find anything. 
I decided to filter by protocoll to only see http traffic.  
There was two images, which I can extract from the .pcapng file. 
I used strings on one of the image and got a base64 encoded text. Then i decrypt it.
Then used steghide on the other and got the flag :)
